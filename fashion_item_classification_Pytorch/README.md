In this project we will use [Kaggle's fashion items dataset](www.kaggle.com) and retrain a ResNet18 architecture model using two transfer learning techniques and choosing the best performing one. Our classification model will be capable of classifying 37 different fashion item types: 
* Backpacks, Belts, Bra, Briefs
* Caps, Casual Shoes, Clutches
* Deodorant, Dresses
* Earrings
* Flats, Flip Flops, Formal Shoes
* Handbags, Heels
* Jackets, Jeans
* Kurtas
* Lipstick
* Nail Polish
* Perfume and Body Mist
* Sandals, Sarees, Shirts, Shorts, Socks, Sports Shoes, Sunglasses, Sweaters, Sweatshirts
* Ties, Tops, Track Pants, Trousers, Tshirts
* Wallets, Watches
